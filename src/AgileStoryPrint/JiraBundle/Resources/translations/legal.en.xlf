                    <p>This page discusses how cookies are used by this site. If you continue to use this site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.</p>

                    <h3>What Cookies Are</h3>
                    <p>Cookies are small files stored on your computer by your web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) at the request of a site you're viewing. This allows the site you're viewing to remember things about you, such as your preferences and history or to keep you logged in.</p>

                    <p>Cookies may be stored on your computer for a short time (such as only while your browser is open) or for an extended period of time, even years. Cookies not set by this site will not be accessible to us.</p>

                    <h3 >Our Cookie Usage</h3>
                    <p>This site uses cookies for numerous things, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analytics. This allows us to determine how people are using the site and improve it.</li>
                        <li>Advertising cookies (possibly third-party). If this site displays advertising, cookies may be set by the advertisers to determine who has viewed an ad or similar things. These cookies may be set by third parties, in which case this site has no ability to read or write these cookies.</li>
                        <li>Other third-party cookies for things like Facebook or Twitter sharing. These cookies will generally be set by the third-party independently, so this site will have no ability to access them.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Removing/Disabling Cookies</h3>
